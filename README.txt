This is a simple and fun drawing board game which has a pixelated trail when your mouse hover on the drawing zone. I created the pixels using css grid method. You can customize the pixel size from the pop up message. The higher number of squares fitting in the same space rendered smaller pixel. You can easily draw by hovering on the drawing zone. to clear the board, just click on the wide green button. The effects of drawing and clearing drawing zone is done by adding and removing classList to change the background color. This is a relatively fast project to finish and I hope you have fun playing!
