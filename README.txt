This is a simple and fun drawing board game which leaves a pixelated trail when your mouse hover on the drawing zone. I created the pixels using css grid method. You can customize the pixels size from the pop up message. The higher the number of squares fitting in the same space rendered smaller pixels and finer lines. You can easily draw by hovering over the drawing zone. The effects of drawing and clearing drawing zone is done by adding and removing classList to change the background color. To clear all drawing, just click on the wide green button. This is a relatively fast project to finish and I hope you have fun playing!
